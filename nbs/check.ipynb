       " 'description': \"Dive into the world of Large Language Model (LLM) integrations with this beginner-friendly course on the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Designed for those new to LLM application development or looking to understand the foundational communication layers, this path will demystify how LLM applications (Hosts) seamlessly interact with various services (Servers) to provide context, tools, and prompts. You'll start by grasping the core architectural concepts and fundamental principles of MCP, then learn how to expose context and functionality using MCP primitives. We'll cover essential techniques for enabling LLM interaction through sampling and equip you with practical debugging and troubleshooting skills for your MCP integrations. By the end of this course, you'll have a solid understanding of MCP's role in modern LLM ecosystems and be ready to build a strong foundation for your first integrated applications.\",\n",
